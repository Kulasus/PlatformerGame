# PlatformerGame
A basic copy of old legendary French game called Prehistorik. It is platformer game in which you play as prehistorik and your goal is to collect as much food as possible. For food you can also hunt animals, but I am not really sure if I will cover this in this repo.
This project is for academical purpose only. I am going to use mainly JavaFX and NetBeans as my IDE.

# TODO
1. Add music
2. Add neceseary stuff for project acceptance
